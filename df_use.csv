Kyoichi comes home from his part-time job as a night-time security guard. He returns to his room to find a girl sleeping on his bed - a girl he has never seen before. She looks a bit older than Kyoichi and is quite beautiful. Kyoichi can't believe his eyes. Kyoichi closes the door and goes outside to the entrance of the apartment, to make sure he's in the right apartment and room. There's no mistake. He returns inside, but the girl is gone. There's nobody in his room. Was it just his imagination? Was he hallucinating? Kyoichi can't understand what just happened. 

Later, he discovers that something is missing from his grocery bag - the Chinese noodles he was looking forward to eating are gone. This is how Kyoichi first meets Surumi Kataoka. After they meet, Surumi continues living in Kyoichi's room. She points to an apartment visible from Kyoichi's room and says that the guy living there dumped her for another girl. Surumi says that she's waiting to check out the girl she was dumped for. Kyoichi doesn't know if he ought to believe her or not. 

All Kyoichi knows is that while Surumi is such a charming girl, the expression on her face is sad at times. Kyoichi is not that disappointed about sharing his room with a cute girl. He starts to think that this lifestyle may go on forever, until one day, Surumi suddenly disappears-just like the day she suddenly appeared.

The female lead, Joo Seo Yeon, is a hot-tempered physical education high school teacher who always wears sneakers, jeans and training uniforms.  The death of her parents helped instill a deep sense of compassion, a generous heart and an outspoken objection for anyone who drinks and drives. Living in a house with three irascible and very attractive brothers, she loathes flower boys. Her ideal type is someone who is not handsome. 

In contrast, the male lead, Lee Kang Woo, is a handsome chaebol who focuses primarily on outer appearance. Initially, he craved attention, oozed arrogance and loved his looks--despite the strict diet and exercise regimen required to maintain it. While he appears flawless, he (like everyone else) was wounded while growing up. And those flaws--along with everyone else's--drive the story.  

Sparks fly when they meet and struggle to overcome their biases for and against people with flaws. Throughout the drama they learn to see beyond appearances to the tragic backstories and scars that motivate themselves and the people around them.",https://i.mydramalist.com/wl01kc.jpg?v=1,25787.0,3215.0

In pursuit of this, they develop three suits of power armor, called Rider Gear (Delta, Faiz, and Kaixa), to find and protect the Orphnoch King, who can fix a defect within Orphnoch DNA which causes their genetic structure to break down, leading to death.
The Rider Gears are stolen by Hanagata, the Goat Orphnoch and former chief of Smart Brain. He sends them to his foster children (dubbed the Ryuseiji, after the school they attended) so they can stop the Orphnoch from achieving their goal. However, Rider Gears were designed to be worn by Orphnoch, and humans are unable to activate the systems without undergoing genetic modification.
A young loner, Takumi Inui, is unwittingly drawn into the conflict between the Orphnoch and humans and becomes Kamen Rider Faiz to save the life of Mari Sonoda, one of the Ryuseiji. The Smart Brain begins targeting him in an attempt to retrieve the Faiz Gear.
However, there is division amongst the Orphnoch, as those who wish to co-exist with humans rather than kill them, begin resisting the Smart Brain, who in turn targets them as well.
